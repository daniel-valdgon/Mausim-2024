Housing

Indicator: Adequate access to water
Scope: Children 0 to 16 years old
Definition: This variable takes the value of one if the household has access to running water within the dwelling. Thus, access includes public network connections and all water pumped into the dwelling, even if it is not from the public network.


Indicator: Access to electricity
Scope: Children 0 to 16 years old
Definition: This variable takes the value of one if the dwelling has access to electricity from any source. Thus, sources can range from the electrical grid system to solar panels.

Indicator: Adequate access to sanitation
Scope: Children 0 to 16 years old
Definition: This variable takes the value of one if the dwelling has access to a flush toilet (either inside the dwelling or inside the property) that is connect- ed to any mechanism whereby household waste is allowed to flow away from the dwelling.

Education

Indicator: School attendance rate
Scope: Children 10 to 14 years old
Definition: This is measured as children aged 10â€“14 attend- ing school, independent of grade. This variable measures the gross attendance rate.


Indicator: Probability of completing sixth grade on time
Scope: Children 12 to 16 years old
Definition: This is measured by computing the probability of having ended sixth grade on time for all children ages 12 to 16. In most countries of the region, this means having completed primary educa- tion. Given that on average children start school at the age of 7, by age 13, students that have survived in the system without repetition should have completed six years of basic education.


Circumstances

1. Parents' education (to capture socioeconomic origin)
2. Family per capita income (to capture availability of resources)
3. Number of siblings (to capture the dependency ratio)
4. The presence of both parents (to capture family structure)
5. Gender of the child (to capture one direct form of discrimination)
6. Gender of the household head (to capture one indirect form of
discrimination)
7. Urban or rural location of residence (to capture spatial disparities)
